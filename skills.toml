# skills.toml — Skill activation configuration
#
# This file controls which skills are enabled and where they're delivered.
# Skills are defined in skills/<name>/SKILL.md. This file selects which
# ones are active at each scope.
#
# Scopes:
#   global  — symlinked to ~/.claude/skills/ (and other global paths)
#   project — symlinked to .claude/skills/ in the target project
#
# Run ./scripts/install.sh after editing to apply changes.

# ─── Global defaults ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Delivery targets for the global scope. The install script creates
# symlinks in each of these directories.

[global]
targets = [
  "~/.claude/skills",
  "~/.config/opencode/skills",
  "~/.agents/skills",
]

# List skills to enable globally (available in every project).
# Use the skill directory name, e.g. "my-skill" for skills/my-skill/SKILL.md
skills = [
  # "git-commit",
  # "code-review",
]

# ─── Project overrides ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Define per-project skill sets. Each key under [projects] is a path
# (absolute or relative to this repo) to a project root. The install
# script symlinks listed skills into that project's .claude/skills/.
#
# Project skills are additive with global skills unless you set
# inherit = false.

# [projects."/path/to/my-project"]
# skills = ["deploy-staging"]
# inherit = true  # default: true — also include global skills

# ─── Permissions ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Optional permission rules matching opencode.json syntax.
# These are written to the target project's opencode.json if present.
#
# [permissions]
# "*" = "allow"
# "internal-*" = "deny"
# "experimental-*" = "ask"
